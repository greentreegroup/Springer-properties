                <h2>Overview</h2>
            
    
                <p style="font-size: 32px; color:black;">Springer Properties is a full service firm specializing in
                     the development, construction and management of high-quality affordable housing. For more than 75 
                     years, Springer Properties has invested in the growth and sustainability of New York City’s neighborhoods
                      through a long-term ownership strategy focused on successful partnerships with government, community 
                      stakeholders and residents. The firm has developed or preserved thousands of affordable apartments and
                       today manages over 6,000 units across the city.
                </p>

                <p style="font-size: 32px; color:black;">
                    Springer Properties was created in 1938 as a real estate management business working with owners of multifamily
                    buildings in upper Manhattan. In the late 1970s, the company began participating in programs aimed at preserving 
                    neighborhood housing resources and reducing the city’s distressed property holdings. Springer Properties earned a
                    reputation as an industry leader for its work on redevelopment projects that led to a growth in its business and
                    a broadening of the firm’s capabilities into the areas of development and construction.
                </p>

                <p style="font-size: 32px; color:black;">
                    Through Springer Properties Development Company LLC, Springer Properties acquires property, assembles and manages 
                    development teams, and arranges financing for new projects. Springer Properties Construction Corp. is Springer Properties'
                    general contracting company with a track record of successfully completing multifamily renovations and new construction projects.
                    Springer Properties also contracts with outside clients. Springer Properties, Inc. is a property management business that manages
                    property for its own portfolio and for nonprofit or for-profit building owners. The company has a team of dedicated professionals
                    with years of management experience and skills in rules and regulations covering affordable housing programs.
                </p>

                <p style="font-size: 32px; color:black;">
                    Springer Properties continues to expand its impact in the affordable housing sector while also delivering market rate housing,
                    mixed-income developments and supportive housing throughout the city. The company’s leadership, reputation, and industry
                    know-how make Springer Properties an ideal partner for a variety of projects, including those with challenging development, 
                    construction, property management, or financial conditions.
