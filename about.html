                    Springer Capital Properties was created in 1938 as a real estate management business working with owners of multifamily
                    buildings in upper Manhattan. In the late 1970s, the company began participating in programs aimed at preserving 
                    neighborhood housing resources and reducing the city’s distressed property holdings. Springer Capital Properties earned a
                    reputation as an industry leader for its work on redevelopment projects that led to a growth in its business and
                    a broadening of the firm’s capabilities into the areas of development and construction.

                                <p style="font-size: 32px; color:black;">Michael Sturmer is a principal with the Springer Capital Properties group of companies. 
                                    He joined the company in 2003 and focuses on its planning, development, and construction activities. Michael has more 
                                    than 25 years of experience in affordable housing and community development, starting in Chicago where he worked with 
                                    community-based groups on the preservation of federally-assisted housing and the implementation of Chicago’s landmark 
                                    landlord-tenant ordinance through resident education and training. In Washington, DC, he worked as a consultant on the 
                                    development of HUD senior housing and repositioning the portfolios of large public housing authorities. Michael has
